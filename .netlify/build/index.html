                        We are deeply moved by human imperfections, whether it be
                        a berthmark or facial hair. With our photography we aim to
                        get closer both to the subject and the viewer. Frankly, we
                        don't follow any brand's guidelins other than curiosity for
                        all things beautiful and woolly.

                        Twin-sister photography duo Tanya and Zhenya Posternak started
                        working together "in the womb", as Tanya teases, or "jokes aside...
                        it happened organically after we moved to New York City and fully
                        focused on photography." Born in Kiev, the sisters moved to New York
                        after graduating from the National Academy of Arts, Ukraine, and have
                        since shot campaigns for Mansur Gavriel and Sunnei, as well a editorial
                        with Vogue Ukraine, Girls on Film and the recent Allure cover featuring Serena Williams.

                        Of the dual influence of growiing up in Ukraine and living in New York, Tanya
                        says: "the memories of our childhood impacts our work massively, but often in
                        a subconcious way". Zhenya agrees, saying: "We're both really grateful to have
                        grown up among the beauty and the ugliness of the soviet union in general, and
                        Ukraine in particular. It's made us more a aware of things Anericans might take
                        for granted. We were taught to `read (and see) between the lines`." And with their
                        homespun influences wrapped in with those of New York, "it results in us being in constant creative
                        state", says Tanya. "It's oftrn stressful, but it keeps us alert and curious".
